# Description

A roller skating social media app.

I picked up roller skating over the pandemic as a way to get outdoors. I was overwhelemed with information such as which skates to get, what basics to practice first, and what type of skating I wanted to do.

This app serves as a platform to connect with rollerskaters through progress posts. You can pin your favourite skate spots and write reviews on your favourite skate item.
